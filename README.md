## Projects

### Dashboard for C8G Teammates
Dashboard for a French freelance company: activity visualization, progress monitoring, task assignment, and payment management. I used React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Clerk to create interactive interfaces that adapt well to different devices. I connected the frontend to the backend built with Prisma, MySQL, and Docker, ensuring effective and secure communication between the application's parts.

### Connectei: Customer Loyalty System

Developed using React, JavaScript, and Material UI. Connected the frontend to the backend using React Query, ensuring effective and secure communication between the application's parts.

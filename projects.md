# Projects

## Dashboard for C8G Teammates
Dashboard for a French freelance company: activity visualization, progress monitoring, task assignment, and payment management. I used React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Clerk to create interactive interfaces that adapt well to different devices. I connected the frontend to the backend built with Prisma, MySQL, and Docker, ensuring effective and secure communication between the application's parts.

## Connectei: Customer Loyalty System
System for a Brazilian company: a comprehensive customer loyalty solution offering order management, analysis of the most popular products, and the implementation of bonuses to promote customer loyalty. Developed using React, JavaScript, and Material UI. Connected the frontend to the backend using React Query, ensuring effective and secure communication between the application's parts.
